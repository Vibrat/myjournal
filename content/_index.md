# Introduction

Welcome, folks!

_I hope you'll find something interesting._ 

Here is what i write about:

* [Math]({{< ref "/docs/math" >}}): mostly about subjects to satisfy my curiosity. 
* [Python]({{< ref "/docs/python" >}}): this is my job, i use `python` to make money as a software engineer. There will be two parts: 
  * One for building software (protocal, asyncio, algorithm, design patterns, ...)
  * One for data science (with libraries such as numpy, pandas, ...)
* And bunch of other interesting stuffs.

All i just taught myself for years (along with professional working), so there are many parts left undone. Please feel free to hit me up  via `lamnguyen10@acm.org`
