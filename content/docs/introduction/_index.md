# About me

## Short description

I started my career as a fullstack engineer in `web` domain but recently moving to work on building data pipeline of `big data` projects. My experience is comprised of:

#### Data pipeline development

Experienced with projects on building data warehouse, streaming pipelines for distributed system, mainly on aggregation level (-- or ETL).

- Using `postgres`, `mysql` for database.
- Using `apache spark`, `apache airflow` for building batching operation.
- Config `nginx` proxy server.
- Perform distributed API query.
- Handle logs retention.
- ...

In the past few years, my works in on maintaining custom tools that handle distributed systems with those similar tools above.

#### Data engineering and Machine Learning

I have an interest in `math` and choose to spend time learning `math` along with data engineering and machine learning. I have an understanding on `linear algebra`, `calculus` that needs for doing some basic regression model like `gradient descent`, `logistics`, `decision tree`,...  One weird thing is that i often find myself re-learning these stuffs again and again -- somehow it's hard to remember for me :).

On 2019 i took my chance to join [Cornell Birdcall Identification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdsong-recognition) which helps to detect bird name based on its sound. The test result is quite good but accuracy is not good when running on production data -- it's overfitting). Feel free to take a look at my code sample below, the model uses `Tensorflow` to build some convolution layers along with `Max Pooling` and `Dropout`.

- Model Training: [Code sample](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vibrat/cornell-bird-sounds-model-training?kernelSessionId=42777080)

#### API, UI, others

- Experienced with `reactjs`, `python`, `linux`, ... for building / deploying api, web platform.
- Experienced with `jenskin`, `docker`, `k8s`, `rpm`, ... for bundling application.
- Also had a little experience with using tool like `figma` to create interface. I don't think i'm really good on this but I bets it's good enough just in case of getting work done.

#### Some code samples

- All my public content will be here: [Public repo](https://github.com/Vibrat/vibrat-public)
- Recently i wrote a analytics engine for blockchain market which listens data on binance spot and doing statistics to predict buy/ sell moment. The project is in [dashboard.tuidoc.com](https://dashboard.tuidoc.com). It's still in development so if you want to give it a try, please help to contact me personally.
